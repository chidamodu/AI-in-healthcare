This repo aims to shed light on multiple use cases spanning to the most important applications of AI to medicine. 

For example, given an image of a chest X-ray, an unstructured image data, can you train a neural network to diagnose whether or not a patient has pneumonia? 

Or given structure data such as the patient's lab results, can you train a decision tree to estimate the risk of heart attack? 

By working on these concrete problems, I aim to gain knowledge on the practical aspects of machine learning from how to deal with imbalanced data sets, to how to 
work with missing data, to picking the right evaluation metric. 

Evaluation metric too? In machine learning, we often default to classification accuracy as the metric. But for many applications, that's not the right metric. So 
how do you choose a more appropriate one?
